## 🚫 About Gatekeeping in the Community

Unfortunately, parts of this project were previously gatekept by certain members who discouraged or prevented others from accessing open-source alternatives and community-driven solutions.

We do **not** support this kind of exclusivity or suppression of knowledge. We believe in transparency, collaboration, and open access to tools and information.
